## üö® **KNOWN ISSUES TO WATCH FOR**

4. **First Order Detection**: Relies on database query, may be slow

---

## üìù **TESTING ACCOUNTS**

Use these test accounts for different scenarios:
- **New User**: No previous orders
- **Existing User**: Has orders from some cafes
- **High Spender**: Has orders from multiple cafes with high amounts

---

## üîç **DEBUGGING TIPS**

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for points calculation logs
2. **Database Queries**: Verify `points_earned` in orders table
3. **Profile Updates**: Check `loyalty_points` in profiles table
4. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Check if subscriptions are active
5. **Network Tab**: Monitor API calls for points updates
