-- Fix Cafe Management Permissions
-- This migration addresses the "Failed to update order acceptance status" error

-- First, let's ensure we have the right RLS policies for cafe management
-- Drop any conflicting policies first
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cafe owners can update their cafe settings" ON public.cafes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cafe owners can manage their menu items" ON public.menu_items;

-- Create more permissive policies for cafe management
-- Allow cafe owners to update their cafe settings
CREATE POLICY "Cafe owners can update their cafe settings" ON public.cafes
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.cafe_staff 
      WHERE cafe_staff.cafe_id = cafes.id 
      AND cafe_staff.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND cafe_staff.role IN ('owner', 'manager')
      AND cafe_staff.is_active = true
    )
  );

-- Allow cafe owners to update their menu items
CREATE POLICY "Cafe owners can manage their menu items" ON public.menu_items
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.cafe_staff 
      WHERE cafe_staff.cafe_id = menu_items.cafe_id 
      AND cafe_staff.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND cafe_staff.role IN ('owner', 'manager')
      AND cafe_staff.is_active = true
    )
  );

-- Also allow cafe owners to select their cafe data
CREATE POLICY "Cafe owners can view their cafe data" ON public.cafes
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.cafe_staff 
      WHERE cafe_staff.cafe_id = cafes.id 
      AND cafe_staff.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND cafe_staff.role IN ('owner', 'manager')
      AND cafe_staff.is_active = true

-- Allow cafe owners to select their menu items
CREATE POLICY "Cafe owners can view their menu items" ON public.menu_items

      AND cafe_staff.role IN ('owner', 'manager')
      AND cafe_staff.is_active = true
    )
  );

-- Ensure cafe_staff table has proper policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Cafe staff can view their assignments" ON public.cafe_staff;
CREATE POLICY "Cafe staff can view their assignments" ON public.cafe_staff
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Add a more permissive policy for debugging (temporary)
-- This will help identify if the issue is with RLS or something else
CREATE POLICY "Temporary permissive cafe update" ON public.cafes
