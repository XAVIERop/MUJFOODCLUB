JOIN public.cafes c ON cs.cafe_id = c.id
WHERE p.email = 'cafe.owner@muj.manipal.edu';

SELECT 'Verifying orders exist:' as status;
SELECT 
  o.order_number,
  o.status,
  o.total_amount,
  c.name as cafe_name,
  COUNT(oi.id) as item_count
FROM public.orders o
JOIN public.cafes c ON o.cafe_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN public.order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id

GROUP BY o.id, o.order_number, o.status, o.total_amount, c.name
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
